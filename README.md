## Data Science Projects  

### Devnagari-Handwritten-Chars-Classification-CNN
This handwritten Devanagari character classification project with utilizes TensorFlow and Keras to build a model capable of recognizing handwritten characters. The dataset, sourced from the “DevanagariHandwrittenCharacterDataset,” contains training and testing data that is loaded and preprocessed using Python libraries such as TensorFlow, Keras, and PIL. Data augmentation techniques, including rotations, shifts, and changes in brightness, are applied to enhance the dataset and improve model generalization. A convolutional neural network (CNN) model is built with multiple convolutional layers, max-pooling layers, and fully connected layers. The model is compiled using Adam optimizer and sparse categorical cross-entropy as the loss function. It is then trained using batches of images and labels, with an additional validation set created from the test dataset. The model’s architecture and performance are visualized using plot_model. Data is preprocessed with TensorFlow’s Rescaling and StringLookup layers, and the datasets are loaded into TensorFlow’s Dataset API for efficient training. The project demonstrates a common pipeline for image classification tasks using deep learning techniques.

### Image Segmentation 
Image segmentation allows machines to interpret visual data by dividing images into meaningful segments, mimicking human perception. This technology is vital in fields like medical imaging, autonomous vehicles, and satellite analysis, where precise object detection is crucial. Our project trains a **U-Net** model on a dataset with 20 object classes to generate accurate object masks and borders. By leveraging convolutional neural networks, the model enhances AI-driven decision-making, improving accuracy in real-world applications such as tumor identification, traffic signal detection, and object localization.
